      <description>For my Master’s thesis, submitted in July 2017, I investigated the voting behaviour of the Scottish electorate in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. More precisely, I was the first attempting to explain voting behaviour in the referendum based on a multivariate quantitative approach. In doing so, I additionally focused on Scots’ attitudes towards the European Union and how these attitudes influence(d) their behaviour at the ballots. Whilst the existing literature on the referendum mostly ignored the European dimension of the independence debate, my results suggest that the Scots did in fact somehow think about the future of Scotland within or outside of the EU when the cast their vote – and that these attitudes did have an effect on how they would decide.</description>
